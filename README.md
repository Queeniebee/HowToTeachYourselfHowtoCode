How To Teach Yourself How to Code
=================================

Led by a person still learning how to code, this session will help you establish a framework for teaching yourself how to code. Having become a bit dissatisfied with the resources currently available for novice programmers, this is a practical workshop designed for new learners without a STEM background.

The two goals in learning how to code successfully is to 
1. always be "productively lost"
2. how to effectively and succinctly articulate what it is that you don't know how to do.

I'll begin by describing patterns I've found across popular programming languages. Next, we will apply those patterns by going through examples. The last third of the workshop will be a summary of resources.

## Agenda 

We will:

* pseudocode a small program 
* Go through best practices for reaching out on mailing lists and IRC
* Setting up an IRC client
* Opportunities to apply your burgeoning skills 
* Overview of some resources. 
* **Extra, extra** ==> A documentation call to action.
